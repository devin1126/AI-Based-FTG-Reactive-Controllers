# AI-Based-FTG-Reactive-Controllers
This repository contains the nominal work found within the paper, ['Neural Process-Based Reactive Controller for Autonomous Racing'](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.12143), where we investigate the efficacy of a neural process-based follow-the-gap racing control law augmented with control-theoretic safety guarantees from a measurement-based control barrier function (CBF) and control-related inductive bias being incorporated via a novel architecture - physics-informed attentive neural process (PI-AttNP). We evaluate all models along with the expert in a simulated F1tenth racing environment, where the simulation and the corresponding installation steps are found [here](https://github.com/F1Tenth-UCF/cavrel_racer).
